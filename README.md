Download the `.pt` file from [here](https://github.com/lernapparat/lernapparat/releases/download/v2019-02-01/karras2019stylegan-ffhq-1024x1024.for_g_all.pt
) and store it inside the folder of this repo with the name `karras2019stylegan-ffhq-1024x1024.for_g_all.pt`.

## Generate faces
Run the following command to generate a face with a custom prompt. In this case the prompt is "The image of a woman with blonde hair and blue eyes"
